This is the case that I designed for the ETX125 focuser. The
source code for generating the case can be found in the _focuser_source_ directory.

The file *focuser_v4.stl* file can be uploaded to [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com) for manufacture. The material that I used is

* Black Strong & Flexible.
