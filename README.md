# An Electric Focuser For The Meade ETX125

One of the most annoying things about the ETX125 is that Meade no
longer makes an electric focuser for
it. [JMI](http://www.jimsmobile.com/buy_motofocus.htm) makes one for
it, but IMO, it's just too expensive. My solution to this problem is
to buy the Meade #1244 electric focuser for the ETX90 or ETX105 (which
costs between $30 to $50 on [ebay](www.ebay.com)) and cannibalize its
parts to make a new focuser for the ETX125.

## The result

I took all the parts of the #1244 _sans_ case, made a new case and
installed it on my ETX125. See the results in the photo
below. Everything fits and now I have a professional looking focuser
for my ETX125.

In the above photo,
* **(a)** shows the arrangement of the gears and circuit board that
have been cannibalized from the #1244 and installed in their new case.
* **(b)** shows the focuser installed on my ETX125. One improvement
that I have made is that the control cable now comes out in the
direction towards the user rather than in the opposite direction.
